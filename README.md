FAHBench
========

FAHBench is the official Folding@Home benchmark. Like the Folding@Home
"cores" being executed by hundreds of thousands of donors across the world
to solve hard problems in protein dynamics, FAHBench is built on the
molecular dynamics engine [OpenMM]. FAHBench works on any OpenCL device, as
well as CUDA-capable Nvidia GPUs. FAHBench is available as a GUI or
command-line based application for Windows and Linux. It is licensed under
GPLv2.
